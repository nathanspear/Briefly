## How It Works

1. **URL Analysis**: The extension extracts key information from company websites:
   - Company URL and domain name
   - Page title and meta description
   - Basic page information (no content scraping)

2. **Company Research Prompt**: Creates a structured research prompt covering 7 key business areas:
   - Company overview and market position
   - Leadership team and founding story
   - Financial performance and business model
   - Cloud strategy and infrastructure
   - FinOps and cost optimization
   - Security operations and compliance

3. **ChatGPT 4o Integration**: Opens ChatGPT 4o and attempts to automatically inject the comprehensive company research prompt

## Customization

### Modifying the Research Prompt
You can customize the research prompt by editing the `createResearchPrompt` function in `background.js` and `popup.js`.

### Adding New Content Selectors
To improve content extraction for specific websites, add new selectors to the `contentSelectors` array in the content extraction functions.

### Changing the Keyboard Shortcut
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/shortcuts`
2. Find "ChatGPT Page Researcher"
3. Click the edit icon and set your preferred shortcut

## Troubleshooting

### The keyboard shortcut doesn't work
- Make sure the extension is enabled
- Check that no other extension is using the same shortcut
- Try refreshing the page and using the shortcut again

### Content isn't being extracted properly
- The extension works best on article pages and content-heavy sites
- Some websites may have unusual structures that aren't recognized
- Try using the popup interface as an alternative

### ChatGPT prompt isn't being injected
- This can happen if ChatGPT's interface has changed
- The prompt will be copied to your clipboard as a fallback
- Simply paste it into ChatGPT manually

### Extension doesn't work on certain pages
- The extension requires permissions to access page content
- Some pages (like Chrome's internal pages) cannot be accessed by extensions
- Make sure you're on a regular website (http:// or https://)

## Privacy & Security

- **No Data Collection**: This extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data
- **Local Processing**: All content extraction happens locally on your device
- **No External Servers**: The extension only communicates with ChatGPT directly
- **Open Source**: All code is available for review in this repository
